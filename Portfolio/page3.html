                <blockquote><p><strong>WHAT IS MACHINE LEARNING ?</strong></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">MACHINE LEARNING is a discipline based within the broader field of </span><span style="font-style: normal;">Artificial Intelligence</span><span style="font-style: normal;"> that </span><strong>teaches</strong><span style="font-style: normal;"> computers to make </span><strong>predictions</strong><span style="font-style: normal;"> based on data.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">The discipline therefore, (1)teaches machines and (2) make predictions. For these two components to function you need </span><strong>data</strong><span style="font-style: normal;">.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Let's look at how both components use data:</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">1. <strong>Learning and Teaching:</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Humans learn through a combination of theory and practice. Computers are of no different. For a machine to understand the benefits and obstacles to your company's success, you must feed it with past experiences. These experiences are units of informations that teach your machines trends and parallels derived from the data, which enable them to forecast future change.</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. Predictions:</strong></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Once the Algorithm has seen enough past observations to be able to identify patterns confidently, you can make accurate predictions on new data. This is were the most valuable insights are extracted to inform the key business decision makers.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>&nbsp;WHY SHOULD WE USE MACHINE LEARNING IN OUR BUSINESS ?</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">In the words of the father of business consulting Peter Drucker, "the business enterprise has only two functions: marketing and innovation. Maketing and innovation produce results; all the rest are cost." These functions, he explains, are conducive to all businesses need: customers.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Both functions - innovation and marketing - can be improved through Machine Learning. As a bonus, you can also used the discipline to knock down company costs.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>INNOVATION</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Google usually pops up as the perfect example of an organisation that uses technology to innovate. A perfect example is the Machine learning algorithm that detects spam emails and expunges them from your inbox.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">This function adds value to their service. Many of us don't even check our spam inbox - half the time we don't even remember its there. Google's function is so useful that it simplifies our life and runs in the background so we can get on with our day.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>MARKETING</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Amazon uses a powerful recommendation engine based on Machine Learning. You will have noticed it in the emails the company sends you about products similar to those you've already bought together with the product that takes your interest.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">By adding a Machine Learning algorithm to online marketing tactics, this little tool uplifts Amazon's sales and revenue by 25%. All the algorithm uses are purchase data to target similar customers. For such a simple idea, Amazon has netted an enormous profit.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>COST</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">In 2017, investment bank JP Morgan found a way to reduce its overhead significantly. It introduced a Machine Learning algorithm that enabled it to automate the process of interpreting commercial loans agreements.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">This move saved the bank 360,000 hours of legal practitioners' work per year - the algorithm could do the work of a human in seconds. Adding the Machine Learning function saved JP Morgan both time and those hefty lawyers' bills.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;"><strong>MACHINE LEARNING AND YOUR BUSINESS</strong>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Strategic thinking is important . Too many executives want to dive straight in, but take a moment to sit back and consider the big picture. Think through your strategy for implementing Machine Learning into your organization.</span></p><p><span style="font-style: normal;">Every business professional should recognise the value of strategic thinking - it is the best way to ensure that you and your team are on the path to success. A detailed outline of the step by step process to develop a well thought-through Machine Learning strategy, to protect you against project setbacks and snags.</span></p></blockquote>

It tracks stock on product lines, it notifies recipients when parcels arrive, it logs customers footfall-there are so many events in our life that generates data. But how can you capture it?<br>Every Machine Learning project requires an initial three stages related to data. Be mindful of them when you're developing your Machine Learning strategy. They are:<br><br>- <strong>Capture</strong> (through sensors, data points on your website, tracking devices on equipment).<br><br>- <strong>Store </strong>(in storage facilities such as SQL or data lakes).<br><br>-<strong>Process % Analyse</strong> (with relevant Machine Learning algorithms)<br>&nbsp;</h4>

                    <h4 class="card-title py-2 mbr-fonts-style display-4"><strong>TOOLS</strong><br>There are lots of tools available to a data scientist - you might have heard of for-profit software such as SAS, SPSS, Matlab. These will help you carry out your Machine Learning experiments. Many organizations prefer to go with commercial tools because it gives them a feeling of security. <br>What they're creating is their intellectual property, and it cannot be easily shared or taken by other people online.<br>But there is also a strong case using open source tools and software.<br>You might be thinking. Open source. Won't that leave my data accessible to hackers? Will others be able to steal my information? If it's free-to-use, surely it can't be very good?<br>These are common misconceptions of what open source actually means. You might be surprised Facebook and Google &nbsp;both use open source tools for their Mahine Learning practices and even their AI algorithms. These tech giants have enormous amount of cash to buy any software if they wished to do so, but they use open source (Specifically, python). <br><strong>Why</strong> ?<br>The value lies in your data, not the tool.</h4>

                    <h4 class="card-title py-2 mbr-fonts-style display-4"><strong>TEAM</strong><br>When you are hiring a team of people to help you with Machine Learning, avoid looking for the 'Unicorn' who will magically solve your problems. Too many organisations want to hire someone to fix all their problems without really thinking through the specifics of what they need. Career sites are flooded with completely unreaslistic job descriptions, looking to find candidates with ten years' experience, a PhD, and knowledge of vast tools and algorithms. These are red flags to the best data scientists - they signal desperate managers who don't understand what Machine Learning does and how it can help to solve problems.<br><br>Tech entrepreneur Lukas Biewald outlines two approaches, one for Small Companies and another for Meduim-to-Large organisations. The former may have budget constraints. If this is the case for you, look for a Machine Learning engineer who is passionate about your company's mission. When they start work, ensure they are not focused on multiple projects. <br>Instead, ask them to prioritise the most critical initiatives. Concerntrating on one project at a time will ensure they deliver maximum value to that specific issue.<br>For medium-to-large enterprises where the budget is not such a constraint, seek to build a team of Mahine Learning engineers. Hire someone who already has experience in the problems you want to solve. Then surround them with a team of support staff who can support them in preparing the data. These could be analyst or business intelligence experts, or they could be people already working in the company, who are passionate about the topic and want to learn more. These support staff should assist the expert with individual components of the project's lifecycle.<br><br><br><br></h4>
